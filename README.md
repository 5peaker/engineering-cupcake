<!-- ABOUT CURRENT STATUS -->
### Current Status

In campus, everyone is waiting for the transition to openCV.
Sadly, however, I am not quite interested in the subject for now.
New Repo wouldn't focus on image processing. GCP and AWS (in free tier, obviously) will be new weapons. 

Let's take course for something <i>interesting</i>, shall we? -Celeste
